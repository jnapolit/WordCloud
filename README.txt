WHAT TO RUN: 
	
	To run the application run the class called wordcloud.py.


DESCRIPTION :

    	This creates either a word cloud with a text file the user inputs or with a file that is defaulted. The defaulted file is a cook book txt file. 
In order to reduce the words like 'the' from being the most frequent words, there is a stopwords text file which the program loops through and then removes all 
those words. 


WAYS TO IMPROVE: 
	
	In the future I would like to work on the overlapping of words problem. Currently I have implemented a grid system to take care of this but I would like to 
improve it with further mathematical thought. I would also like to all the user to be able to place their word cloud in a certain shape as seen with the elephant 
example in the splashscreen.
